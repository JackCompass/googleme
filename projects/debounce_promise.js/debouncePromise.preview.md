# **Debounce Promise (A NPM Package)**
Deboune Promise is just a bash script that help you to store and fetch your credentials. All the data is going to remain in your local storage.
In a nutshell it is just a utility script that I use to store and fetch the credentials that I use frequently from the command line itself.
