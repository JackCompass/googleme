# **Enstore**
Enstore is just a bash script that help you to store and fetch your credentials. All the data is going to remain on your local drive/storage.
In a nutshell it is just a utility script that could be used to store and fetch the credentials on the command line itself.

Generally, we store credentials somewhere in our system and when we need them we open the file and copy it and then use it. This is a bit little cumbersome when you have to do it frequently.
But what if you could just run a command and get the credentials in your clipboard. That's what enstore does. I must say this is not a new idea.
The best way to use it is to create an alias for the command and then use it. I have created an alias for it and I use it frequently.

**Soon will upload the code on GitHub**
