# Snippets
A platform built for developers to share code snippets. The inspiration to build this platform came from GitHub gists.
It addresses most of the pain points if not all of GitHub gists. 
Snippets provide a very use friendly way to organise the snippets and allow to search and browse it as we do on social media.
It supports live language detection and also provides a way to share the output of the snippet.
It is completely open source and can be used by anyone.
